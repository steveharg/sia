# The SIA and SIATEC Algorithms

The purpose of this research is to investigate how amenable Semantic Web technologies are to algorithmic music content analysis, and we made the decision to work with symbolic data for reasons of tractability.  

Two such candidates are the pair of pattern discovery algorithms SIA (‘Structure Induction Algorithm’) and SIATEC (‘Structure Induction Algorithm Translational Equivalence Class’) by Meredith et al. (2002). 
These algorithms represent music (as well as other types of) data as a multidimensional dataset, and take a geometrical approach to analysis. The use of multidimensional data allows us to analyse polyphonic music (i.e. instrument or channel number may be one of our dimensions) as well as multiple facets of music data, for example onset time, offset time, pitch or timbre. Taking a geometrical approach to pattern discovery allows us to easily detect repeat patterns of notes which have been shifted in (for example) pitch. This aspect of SIA and SIATEC is extremely useful, given the perceptual significance of chromatic pitch transposition.
